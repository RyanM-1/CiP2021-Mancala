Let's play Mancala!  Mancala is played with a board that has 12 small wells, 6 for each player, that are initially

each filled with 4 stones.  There is also a larger well (called "mancala") for each player on their far right that starts empty.

Players alternate turns.  A turn consists of picking up all the stones in a well on the player's side of the board and

placing 1 stone in each well in sequence going counter-clockwise (to the right) until all stones are placed.  Stones placed in

the player's mancala count toward the players final score.  If a player puts a stone in their mancala and still has more stones

to place, they start placing them in the opponent's wells, going from right to left.  A player cannot place a stone in the

opponent's mancala.  Play continues until one player's side of the board has no stones left, at which point the other player

takes all of the stones on their side for their own mancala.  Whoever has the most stones in their mancala wins!

Special rule #1:  If a player's last stone placed on their turn is in their mancala, they take another turn.

Special rule #2:  If a player's last stone placed on their turn is in an empty well on their side and there are any stones in

the well on the opposite side, they put that stone along with all the stones in the opposite well into their own mancala.'''
